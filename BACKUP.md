# Backup and Restore Architecture

## Overview

pg-swarm provides managed backup and restore through two entities:

- **Backup Stores** — centrally managed storage destinations (S3, GCS, SFTP, local) with encrypted-at-rest credentials. Created in the Admin console. Multiple backup profiles can share a single store.
- **Backup Profiles** — define what to back up (physical, logical, or both), when (cron schedules), and how long to keep it (retention). Each profile references exactly one backup store.

Backup profiles attach to cluster profiles, which deploy to satellites via deployment rules. The satellite operator injects a **backup sidecar** container into each StatefulSet pod. The sidecar detects its role (primary vs replica) and activates the appropriate responsibilities. No CronJobs are used.

---

## Backup Stores

A backup store is a reusable storage destination managed centrally via the Admin console.

### Store Types

| Type | Use Case | Config Fields | Credential Fields |
|------|----------|---------------|-------------------|
| `s3` | AWS S3 or S3-compatible (MinIO) | bucket, region, endpoint, force_path_style | access_key_id, secret_access_key |
| `gcs` | Google Cloud Storage | bucket | service_account_json |
| `sftp` | Remote SFTP server | host, port, user, base_path | password, private_key |
| `local` | Local PersistentVolumeClaim | size, storage_class | — |

### Credential Encryption

Store credentials are encrypted at rest in the central PostgreSQL database using **AES-256-GCM**:

- The central server reads a 32-byte encryption key from the `ENCRYPTION_KEY` environment variable (hex-encoded, 64 characters)
- On create/update, credential fields are marshaled to JSON and encrypted as a single BYTEA blob (`nonce || ciphertext || tag`)
- Non-secret config (bucket, region, host, etc.) is stored as plaintext JSONB for visibility
- The REST API never returns raw credential values — only a `credentials_set` map indicating which fields are populated (e.g., `{"access_key_id": true, "secret_access_key": true}`)

### Credential Flow to Satellites

When a cluster config is pushed to a satellite:
1. Central decrypts the store credentials from the database
2. Credentials are embedded in the protobuf `BackupStoreConfig` message
3. The satellite operator creates a K8s Secret (`<cluster>-backup-creds-<id>`) containing the credentials
4. The backup sidecar reads credentials from the Secret via environment variables

### REST API

```
GET    /api/v1/backup-stores           List all stores (credentials masked)
POST   /api/v1/backup-stores           Create store (encrypts credentials)
GET    /api/v1/backup-stores/:id       Get store (credentials masked)
PUT    /api/v1/backup-stores/:id       Update store (re-encrypts credentials)
DELETE /api/v1/backup-stores/:id       Delete store (fails if profiles reference it)
```

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE backup_stores (
    id          UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    name        TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    description TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
    store_type  TEXT NOT NULL,              -- 's3', 'gcs', 'sftp', 'local'
    config      JSONB NOT NULL DEFAULT '{}', -- non-secret connection params
    credentials BYTEA NOT NULL DEFAULT '',   -- AES-256-GCM encrypted secrets
    created_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW(),
    updated_at  TIMESTAMPTZ NOT NULL DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

## Backup Profiles

A backup profile defines schedules, retention, and references a backup store. Profiles attach to cluster profiles for deployment.

### Profile Spec

```json
{
  "physical": {
    "base_schedule": "0 4 * * *",
    "incremental_schedule": "0 * * * *",
    "wal_archive_enabled": true,
    "archive_timeout_seconds": 60
  },
  "logical": {
    "schedule": "0 2 * * *",
    "databases": [],
    "format": "custom"
  },
  "backup_store_id": "uuid-of-the-backup-store",
  "retention": {
    "base_backup_count": 7,
    "incremental_backup_count": 23,
    "wal_retention_days": 14,
    "logical_backup_count": 30
  }
}
```

Note: `destination` has been replaced by `backup_store_id`. The destination configuration lives entirely in the referenced backup store.

### Constraints

- A cluster profile can have at most **one physical** and **one logical** backup profile attached
- A profile must reference a valid backup store
- Physical profiles with WAL archiving validate that WAL retention days cover the base backup schedule span

### REST API

```
GET    /api/v1/backup-profiles                      List all backup profiles
POST   /api/v1/backup-profiles                      Create a backup profile
GET    /api/v1/backup-profiles/:id                  Get a backup profile
PUT    /api/v1/backup-profiles/:id                  Update a backup profile
DELETE /api/v1/backup-profiles/:id                  Delete a backup profile
POST   /api/v1/profiles/:id/attach-backup-profile   Attach profile to cluster profile
POST   /api/v1/profiles/:id/detach-backup-profile   Detach profile from cluster profile
GET    /api/v1/profiles/:id/backup-profiles         List attached backup profiles
```

### Attach / Detach Flow

**Attach** (`POST /api/v1/profiles/:id/attach-backup-profile`):
1. Insert row into `profile_backup_profiles` join table
2. Bump `config_version` on all ClusterConfigs linked via deployment rules
3. Re-push configs to satellites (now includes `BackupConfig` with store details)
4. Operator reconciles: credential Secret, backup RBAC, backup sidecar injected into StatefulSet, `archive_command` set

**Detach** (`POST /api/v1/profiles/:id/detach-backup-profile`):
1. Delete row from `profile_backup_profiles` join table
2. Bump `config_version` on all linked ClusterConfigs
3. Re-push configs (backup config removed)
4. Operator reconciles: sidecar removed, `archive_command` reset, credentials cleaned up

## Destination Folder Structure

Every satellite-cluster combination gets a standardized folder in the backup store:

```
<backup-store-root>/
├── edge-nyc-prod-pg/                       # <satellite-name>-<cluster-name>
│   ├── backups.db                          # Portable SQLite metadata copy
│   ├── base/
│   │   ├── 20260317T040000Z.tar.gz         # Gzipped base backup
│   │   └── 20260317T040000Z_manifest.gz    # pg_basebackup manifest
│   ├── inc/
│   │   ├── 20260317T050000Z.tar.gz         # Gzipped incremental
│   │   └── 20260317T050000Z_manifest.gz
│   ├── wal/
│   │   ├── 000000010000000000000001.gz     # Gzipped WAL segments
│   │   └── 000000010000000000000002.gz
│   └── logical/
│       └── 20260317T020000Z_mydb.sql.gz    # Gzipped pg_dump output
├── edge-lon-prod-pg/
│   ├── backups.db
│   └── ...
```

**Key conventions:**
- Folder prefix: `<satellite-name>-<cluster-name>` (using satellite hostname, not UUID)
- All files are gzipped
- Subfolder names: `base/`, `inc/`, `wal/`, `logical/`
- `backups.db` is a portable SQLite copy synced after each operation — enables import into a different swarm

### Dual Metadata

- **Central DB** (`backup_inventory` table) is authoritative for the dashboard and API
- **`backups.db`** in the store folder is a portable copy for disaster recovery and future import
- Both are updated after each backup/restore operation

---

## Split-Responsibility Model

The backup sidecar detects its role by querying `pg_is_in_recovery()` and activates the appropriate responsibilities:

### Primary sidecar responsibilities:
1. **WAL archiving** — HTTP endpoint receives WAL from `archive_command`, compresses, uploads to `wal/`
2. **Metadata DB** — single writer to `backups.db` (SQLite), ingests backup completion notifications from replica
3. **WAL fetch** — serves `restore_command` requests (downloads WAL from destination for recovery)
4. **Retention** — deletes expired backups/WAL/logical dumps and cascades metadata

### Replica sidecar responsibilities:
1. **Base backups** — `pg_basebackup -h localhost` on schedule, uploads to `base/`
2. **Incremental backups** — `pg_basebackup --incremental` on schedule, uploads to `inc/` (PG 17+, with standby WAL fallback)
3. **Logical backups** — `pg_dump`/`pg_dumpall` on schedule, uploads to `logical/`
4. **Notify primary** — after each backup, POST metadata to primary sidecar's HTTP API

### Role discovery and failover:
- Each sidecar checks `SELECT pg_is_in_recovery()` on startup and every 10 seconds
- **Primary** (`pg_is_in_recovery() = false`): activates WAL archiving + metadata + retention
- **Replica** (`pg_is_in_recovery() = true`): activates backup scheduler
- On failover (role change detected): sidecar switches responsibilities automatically

### Single-replica or standalone (replicas=1):
- The single pod is the primary — sidecar handles everything: WAL + backups + metadata
- No cross-pod communication needed

---

## Sidecar Startup Store Check

On startup, before activating role-specific responsibilities, the backup sidecar checks the store for existing backups:

```
startup
  ├── destination init (from store config)
  ├── checkExistingBackups()
  │     ├── Check if <prefix>/backups.db exists in store
  │     ├── If yes: download, query available restore points
  │     │     ├── Latest base backup timestamp
  │     │     ├── Oldest base backup timestamp
  │     │     ├── WAL range (earliest to latest LSN)
  │     │     └── List of base backups with timestamps
  │     └── Report to central via BackupStatusReport (store_check variant)
  ├── detectRole()
  └── activateRole()
```

This enables:
- **Initial cluster setup**: If the store has existing backups for this satellite+cluster, central can offer PITR restore before the cluster starts serving traffic
- **Cluster recreation**: If a cluster is deleted and recreated pointing at the same store, it can restore from the previous backups

---

## Pre-Backup Health Gate

The backup sidecar performs health checks to avoid running backups on unhealthy clusters where the data may be stale, incomplete, or divergent. This prevents the most dangerous backup failure mode: a backup that **succeeds** but captures inconsistent data, only discovered at restore time.

### Risks addressed

| Scenario | Backup Type | Risk Without Health Gate |
|----------|-------------|--------------------------|
| Replica not streaming WALs | Base backup | Backup captures **stale data** — restore loses transactions |
| Primary fenced / promoting | WAL archive | Partial WAL segments — **breaks PITR chain** |
| Failover in progress | Any | Role flip mid-backup — half-written files on destination |
| Primary in crash recovery | WAL archive | Recovery-generated WALs may be missed |
| Network partition | Replica base | Replica diverged — **silent data divergence** |

### Startup readiness gate

After `detectRole()` and before `activateRole()`, the sidecar calls `waitForClusterReady()`:

```
detectRole() → waitForClusterReady() → activateRole() → scheduler starts
```

**`waitForClusterReady(ctx)`** polls every 5 seconds for up to 5 minutes:

- **Replica**: queries `pg_stat_wal_receiver` — checks `status = 'streaming'` and `received_lsn IS NOT NULL`. Confirms streaming replication is established before any backup runs.
- **Primary**: queries `SELECT pg_current_wal_lsn()` — confirms WAL generation is active (implies checkpoint completed). Primary backups are WAL-only, so no need to check replica connectivity.
- **On timeout**: logs warning but proceeds with `readyClean = false`. A degraded backup is better than no backup for a new cluster. The flag annotates the first status report.

### Per-backup health check

Before every scheduled backup, the scheduler calls `checkHealth()`:

```go
type HealthStatus struct {
    Healthy             bool
    WalReceiverStatus   string // "streaming", "stopped", "catchup", "unknown"
    ReplicationLagBytes int64  // bytes behind primary (replica only)
    Reason              string // why unhealthy, empty if healthy
}
```

**Replica checks** (base/incremental/logical backups):
1. Query `pg_stat_wal_receiver` for receiver status
2. Compute lag: `pg_wal_lsn_diff(pg_last_wal_receive_lsn(), pg_last_wal_replay_lsn())`
3. **Healthy** if: `status = 'streaming'` and lag < 64 MB (4 WAL segments)
4. **Unhealthy** if: no rows in `pg_stat_wal_receiver`, or `status != 'streaming'`, or lag exceeds threshold

**Primary checks** (WAL archiving — informational only):
1. Query `SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE backend_type = 'walsender'`
2. Reports connected replica count. WAL archiving continues regardless — PG handles archive safety natively.

### Behavior on unhealthy

When `checkHealth()` returns unhealthy:
- **Skip** the scheduled backup — don't run a stale/risky backup
- **Log** a warning with reason, WAL receiver status, and lag bytes
- **Report** to central via ConfigMap reporter with `status: "skipped"` and reason
- **Next cron tick retries automatically** — no circuit breaker or backoff needed. The cron schedule naturally handles retry. If the cluster recovers, backups resume. If the cluster stays unhealthy, the repeated skip warnings in central's event stream alert the operator.

**Initial base backup exception**: The first base backup after role activation retries the health check every 30 seconds for up to 10 minutes before giving up. If still unhealthy after 10 minutes, it proceeds anyway — a stale first backup is better than no backup at all for a new cluster.

### Health-annotated status reports

Every `BackupStatusReport` includes health context:

```protobuf
int64 replication_lag_bytes = 14;   // WAL lag at time of backup (replica only)
string wal_receiver_status = 15;   // "streaming", "stopped", "unknown"
bool health_check_passed = 16;     // false if backup ran despite health warning
```

This enables:
- **Dashboard**: warning icon on backups where `health_check_passed = false` or `replication_lag_bytes` is high
- **Restore decisions**: operator can see if a backup was taken during cluster instability and choose a different restore point
- **Audit trail**: central's backup inventory table stores the health annotations for each backup record

### What is NOT done (by design)

- **Central-driven pause**: no central→satellite→sidecar control path exists, and adding one would be over-engineered. The sidecar is self-sufficient.
- **Failover sidecar integration**: the backup and failover sidecars are independent by design (no shared state). Adding inter-sidecar communication creates coupling.
- **Blocking on DEGRADED state**: a degraded cluster (1 of 2 replicas down) still has a healthy replica. Backups from the healthy one should continue.
- **Circuit breaker / exponential backoff**: the cron schedule already provides natural retry spacing. A skipped 4-hour backup will retry in 4 hours — exponential backoff would delay recovery further.

### File summary

| File | Change |
|------|--------|
| `internal/backup/healthcheck.go` | **New** — `HealthStatus` struct, `checkHealth()`, `waitForClusterReady()` |
| `internal/backup/sidecar.go` | Insert `waitForClusterReady()` in `Run()` between detectRole and activateRole |
| `internal/backup/scheduler.go` | Add health gate in `runWithRecovery()`, skip + report on unhealthy |
| `internal/backup/physical.go` | Pass health context to backup status annotation |
| `internal/backup/logical.go` | Pass health context to backup status annotation |
| `api/proto/v1/backup.proto` | Add `replication_lag_bytes`, `wal_receiver_status`, `health_check_passed` to `BackupStatusReport` |

## Restore

### PITR (Physical)

Available from two entry points:
1. **Cluster Detail > Backups tab**: "Restore PITR" button on each completed base backup row, with timestamp picker constrained between backup time and next backup (or now)
2. **Initial cluster setup**: If sidecar reports existing backups on startup, dashboard offers restore option

Flow:
1. User picks a base backup + target time in the dashboard
2. `POST /api/v1/clusters/:id/restore` → Central creates `RestoreOperation` (pending)
3. Central sends `RestoreCommand` via gRPC to satellite (includes `BackupStoreConfig` with decrypted credentials)
4. Satellite creates a K8s Job that:
   - Scales StatefulSet to 0
   - Downloads base backup from store
   - Extracts to data volume
   - Sets `recovery_target_time` + `restore_command` in `postgresql.auto.conf`
   - Creates `recovery.signal`
   - Scales StatefulSet back up
5. Satellite sends `RestoreStatusReport` via gRPC
6. Central updates `restore_operations` table

### Logical

1. User picks a logical backup in the Cluster Detail > Backups tab
2. Satellite creates a Job running `pg_restore` against the primary
3. Reports completion via `RestoreStatusReport`

### REST API

```
GET    /api/v1/clusters/:id/backups    List cluster backup inventory
GET    /api/v1/backups/:id             Get single backup record
POST   /api/v1/clusters/:id/restore    Initiate a restore (PITR or logical)
GET    /api/v1/clusters/:id/restores   List cluster restore operations
```

---

## archive_command / restore_command

When backup profiles are attached, the operator configures PostgreSQL to use the sidecar:

```
archive_command = 'curl -sf -X POST -F file=@%p -F name=%f http://localhost:8442/wal/push'
restore_command = 'curl -sf -o %p http://localhost:8442/wal/fetch?name=%f'
```

- `archive_command` POSTs WAL to the local backup sidecar. Blocks until durable upload. PG only marks WAL as archived after curl returns 0.
- `restore_command` fetches WAL from the sidecar, which downloads from the store.

---

## Sidecar HTTP API (:8442)

| Method | Path | Role | Purpose |
|--------|------|------|---------|
| POST | `/wal/push` | Primary | Receives WAL from archive_command, compresses, uploads |
| GET | `/wal/fetch?name=` | Primary | Serves WAL for restore_command |
| POST | `/backup/complete` | Primary | Receives backup metadata from replica |
| GET | `/healthz` | Both | Health check |

    throughput_mbps  REAL,
    tables_count    INTEGER,
    db_size_bytes   INTEGER,
    extra_json      TEXT
);
```

Retention cascade: `DELETE FROM backup_sets WHERE id=?` cascades to all `backups`, `wal_segments`, and `backup_stats` rows for that set.

## Protobuf

The `BackupConfig` message in `api/proto/v1/backup.proto`:

```protobuf

The `base_path` field is computed by central when building the proto message: `fmt.Sprintf("%s-%s", satelliteName, clusterName)`.

## Status Reporting

```
Backup sidecar → ConfigMap (<cluster>-backup-status)
                       │
                Health monitor tick (10s)
                       │
                BackupStatusReport (gRPC stream)
                       │
                Central: upsert backup_inventory row + create Event
```

## Sidecar Container

- **Image**: `ghcr.io/pg-swarm/pg-swarm-backup-sidecar:latest`
- **Base**: `postgres:17` (includes pg_basebackup, pg_dump, psql) + aws-cli, openssh-client
- **Port**: 8442
- **Entry point**: Go binary (`backup-sidecar`), long-running daemon
- **Metadata**: Pure Go SQLite (`modernc.org/sqlite`), no external sqlite3 binary needed

## Backup Sequence

### 1. Init container (`pg-init`)

**Primary (ordinal 0) — first boot:**
- `initdb` → starts PG locally → creates `repl_user`, `backup_user`, app databases → stops PG
- Copies ConfigMap `postgresql.conf` / `pg_hba.conf` into PGDATA
- `archive_command` is set to `cp %p /wal-staging/%f` (staging emptyDir shared with backup sidecar)

**Replica (ordinal > 0) — first boot:**
- Waits for primary, runs `pg_basebackup -R -Xs`
- Copies ConfigMap into PGDATA
- Injects `restore_command` into `postgresql.auto.conf` — a shell script that writes the WAL name to `/wal-restore/.request` and polls until the sidecar places the file at `/wal-restore/<name>`

**Any pod — re-init / restart (PGDATA already exists):**
- Copies config only
- If `standby.signal` present → checks for timeline divergence → runs `pg_rewind` or falls back to `pg_basebackup`
- Writes `standby.signal` + `primary_conninfo` pointing to the RW service

---

### 2. Wrapper script (main container loop)

Before PG starts each iteration:
- `pg_swarm_recover()`: detects timeline divergence → `pg_rewind` → WAL cleanup (REDO segment + checkpoint record segment) → falls back to `pg_basebackup` if rewind fails
- Checks `.pg-swarm-needs-basebackup` marker (set by failover sidecar or backup sidecar)
- Final guard: verifies checkpoint WAL segment exists before handing off to `docker-entrypoint.sh`

Then PG starts. On exit → loop repeats.

---

### 3. Backup sidecar (`Run()`)

Starts concurrently with PG in the same pod.

```
startup
  ├── destination init (from store config via env vars)
  ├── checkExistingBackups()           — reports available restore points to central
  ├── go WatchWALRestore()             — MUST start before detectRole()
  │     polls /wal-restore/.request every 500ms
  │     downloads+decompresses WAL from store → /wal-restore/<name>
  │     (needed so restore_command doesn't deadlock PG during recovery)
  ├── detectRole()                     — retries pg_is_in_recovery() for up to 60s
  └── waitForClusterReady()            — polls PG health for up to 5min (see Health Gate)
```

**If primary:**
```
activatePrimary()
  ├── download or create backups.db (SQLite metadata) from store
  ├── ensure active backup set exists
  ├── go WatchWALStaging()   — polls /wal-staging/ every 1s
  │     compress + upload WAL → store/<prefix>/wal/<name>.gz
  │     record segment in metadata
  │     delete local copy
  ├── go api.Start(:8442)    — /backup/complete, /healthz, legacy push/fetch
  └── NewRetentionWorker()   — prunes old backup sets
```

**If replica:**
```
activateReplica()
  ├── go api.Start(:8442)    — /healthz only
  ├── NewNotifier()          — reaches primary sidecar HTTP API
  └── go scheduler.Run()
        ├── immediate: checkHealth() → RunBaseBackup() (retries health every 30s up to 10min)
        ├── baseTicker  → checkHealth() → RunBaseBackup()      → store/<prefix>/base/
        ├── incrTicker  → checkHealth() → RunIncrBackup()      → store/<prefix>/inc/
        └── logicTicker → checkHealth() → RunLogicalBackup()   → store/<prefix>/logical/
        (if checkHealth() returns unhealthy: skip backup, log warning, report "skipped")
```

**Role-change watcher** (every 10s): calls `pg_is_in_recovery()` → if role changed, `deactivate()` → `activateRole()` with new role. This is how the sidecar transitions after a failover (replica → primary).

---

### Key shared volumes (emptyDir, pod-scoped)

| Volume | Direction | Who writes | Who reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `/wal-staging` | PG → sidecar | PG `archive_command` | `WatchWALStaging` |
| `/wal-restore` | sidecar → PG | `WatchWALRestore` | PG `restore_command` |

---

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Encryption Utilities
- New `internal/central/crypto/` package — AES-256-GCM encrypt/decrypt
- Key from `ENCRYPTION_KEY` env var, passed to RESTServer

### Phase 2: Backup Stores
- Migration: `backup_stores` table
- Models: `BackupStore`, `BackupStoreConfig`, `BackupStoreCredentials`
- Store interface: 5 CRUD methods
- REST API: 5 endpoints
- Dashboard: `BackupStoresTab` in Admin page

### Phase 3: Backup Profile Migration
- Migration: add `backup_store_id` to `backup_profiles`, migrate seed profiles, strip `destination`
- Models: replace `Destination` with `BackupStoreID` in `BackupProfileSpec`
- REST: resolve store when building proto configs
- Dashboard: replace destination tab with store selector

### Phase 4: Proto Updates
- Replace `BackupDestination` with `BackupStoreConfig` in `BackupConfig`
- Add `BackupStoreConfig` message with `base_path` field
- Add health context fields to `BackupStatusReport`: `replication_lag_bytes`, `wal_receiver_status`, `health_check_passed`
- Run `make proto`

### Phase 5: Sidecar Updates
- Add `SatelliteName` to config, update `destPrefix()` to use name instead of UUID
- Add `checkExistingBackups()` on startup
- Verify subfolder paths: `wal/`, `base/`, `inc/`, `logical/`
- Add `waitForClusterReady()` startup gate (polls `pg_stat_wal_receiver` / `pg_current_wal_lsn`)
- Add `checkHealth()` per-backup gate — skips backup + reports "skipped" when cluster unhealthy
- Annotate backup status reports with health context (lag, WAL receiver status)

### Phase 6: Operator Updates
- Uncomment sidecar injection in `manifest_statefulset.go`
- Update `manifest_backup.go` to use `backup.Store` instead of `backup.Destination`
- Re-enable backup RBAC and credential secret reconciliation

### Phase 7: Dashboard PITR UI
- ClusterDetail > Backups tab: "Restore PITR" button per base backup
- Restore modal with timestamp picker and confirmation
- Initial cluster setup: restore prompt if store has existing backups

### Phase 8: Documentation
- Update CLAUDE.md, README.md, DESIGN.md, CHANGELOG.md
- Add `ENCRYPTION_KEY` to configuration tables
